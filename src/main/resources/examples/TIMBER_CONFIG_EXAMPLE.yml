# Timber Mechanic - Example Configuration

# The Timber mechanic allows players to chop down entire trees at once.
# When a player breaks a log block with a tool that has this mechanic enabled,
# all connected logs (and optionally leaves) of the same tree will be broken automatically.

# Example Diamond Axe with Timber:
diamond_axe:
  material: DIAMOND_AXE
  Mechanics:
    timber:
      limit: 100              # Maximum number of blocks to break (logs + leaves)
      max_height: 32          # Maximum height difference from the origin block
      toggleable: true        # Whether players can toggle this mechanic on/off (right-click)
      break_leaves: false     # Whether to break leaves as well
      whitelist:              # Optional: Specific logs that can be broken
        - OAK_LOG             # Vanilla materials
        - SPRUCE_LOG
        - BIRCH_LOG
        - custom_nexo_log     # Nexo custom block IDs

# Example Iron Axe with Timber (auto-breaks leaves):
iron_axe_with_leaves:
  material: IRON_AXE
  Mechanics:
    timber:
      limit: 150
      max_height: 40
      toggleable: true
      break_leaves: true      # Will also break leaves around the tree
      whitelist: []           # Empty whitelist = works on all default tree logs

# Example Stone Axe with limited range:
stone_axe_limited:
  material: STONE_AXE
  Mechanics:
    timber:
      limit: 30               # Only breaks up to 30 blocks
      max_height: 20          # Only reaches 20 blocks high
      toggleable: false       # Always active
      break_leaves: false
      whitelist:
        - OAK_LOG
        - SPRUCE_LOG

# How it works:
# 1. When a player breaks a log with a timber tool, the mechanic activates
# 2. It searches for connected logs of the same type (vertically and diagonally)
# 3. All found logs (up to the limit) are broken automatically
# 4. If break_leaves is true, nearby leaves are also broken
# 5. If toggleable is true, players can toggle the mechanic by right-clicking with the tool

# Toggle Messages (configured in config.yml):
# messages:
#   timber:
#     enabled: "<green>Timber enabled"
#     disabled: "<red>Timber disabled"

# Notes:
# - The mechanic respects protection plugins (like WorldGuard, GriefPrevention, etc.)
# - If whitelist is empty, it works on all default tree logs
# - Works with both vanilla and Nexo custom blocks
# - Only breaks logs of the same type (e.g., oak logs only break oak logs)
