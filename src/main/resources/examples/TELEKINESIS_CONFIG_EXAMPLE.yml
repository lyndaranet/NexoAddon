# Telekinesis Mechanic - Example Configuration

# The Telekinesis mechanic makes broken blocks drop directly into the player's inventory
# instead of dropping on the ground. This works with any tool that has this mechanic enabled.
# It can be combined with other mechanics like BigMining, VeinMiner, Timber, etc.

# Example Diamond Pickaxe with Telekinesis:
diamond_pickaxe_telekinesis:
  material: DIAMOND_PICKAXE
  Mechanics:
    telekinesis:
      enabled: true           # Enable the telekinesis mechanic

# Example Iron Pickaxe with Telekinesis AND VeinMiner:
iron_pickaxe_multi:
  material: IRON_PICKAXE
  Mechanics:
    telekinesis:
      enabled: true           # Broken blocks go directly to inventory
    veinminer:
      distance: 15
      toggleable: true
      same_material: true
      limit: 64
      whitelist:
        - IRON_ORE
        - DIAMOND_ORE
        - nexo_custom_ore

# Example Axe with Telekinesis AND Timber:
super_axe:
  material: NETHERITE_AXE
  Mechanics:
    telekinesis:
      enabled: true           # All logs from Timber go directly to inventory
    timber:
      limit: 200
      max_height: 50
      toggleable: true
      break_leaves: true
      whitelist: []

# Example Shovel with Telekinesis AND BigMining:
super_shovel:
  material: DIAMOND_SHOVEL
  Mechanics:
    telekinesis:
      enabled: true           # All broken dirt/sand goes directly to inventory
    bigmining:
      radius: 1               # 3x3 area (1 block in each direction)
      depth: 1                # 3 blocks deep
      switchable: true        # Toggle with right-click
      whitelist:
        - DIRT
        - SAND
        - GRAVEL

# How it works:
# 1. When a player breaks a block with a telekinesis tool, the drops are calculated
# 2. Instead of dropping on the ground, items are added directly to the player's inventory
# 3. If the inventory is full, leftover items will drop on the ground normally
# 4. Works in Survival mode only (Creative mode is ignored)
# 5. Combines perfectly with VeinMiner, Timber, BigMining, and other mining mechanics

# Benefits:
# - No need to pick up items from the ground
# - Prevents items from falling into lava or water
# - Works great in tight spaces or dangerous areas
# - Reduces lag from item entities on the ground
